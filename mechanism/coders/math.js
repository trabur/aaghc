// with CPU, M, and HD all in one machine we can do some interesting things.
// let's say for a moment we had a box with a combination lock on the inside.
// the lock is simple: close the box and the information put inside it goes away.
// open the box and information is revealed. with one time pads we can limit
// this function, observe, and repeat forever.

// so let's say we have one box and a single piece of information. very basic.
// let's call our box A and our piece of information 1. here are a few things that
// we know: if we add more boxes then we get B, C, D, etc. and if we add more
// information then we get 2, 3, 4, etc.

// let's just stick to box A and piece of information 1 for now. actually, the
// two things are interchangeable. because we only know two things and because 
// we only have two things .. the minimun number of guesses that need to be made
// to figure out the key/lock combination is: 1 + 1 = 2.

// one time pads have a particular thing about them that make them special.
// once a new message is discovered, decoded using key over lock factoring,
// then said key must never be used again.

// if the key is seen again then it becomes a running key. yet without running
// keys there would be no repitition. if there is no repitition then there is no
// pattern. no pattern then no information. a system of 100% noise means there
// is all chaos and no order with zero chance of survival. nothing can be 
// determined from it unless the secret is known. back to square one. loop 
// until halt.

// for each halt we shift our character to it's opposite case and try again.
// being born into this world has it's challenges. as if an entire load
// of data gets dumped onto us newbs all at once and then bit by bit with exp we
// figuring out one variable at a time. how to turn data into messages and
// back is the race; win the race, make a career out of it, or call it racism.
// it is what it is // what = plus

// this is because the concept of race with data and messages is systemic. 
// messages are just that: an "age" which is a number and a "mess" which is a
// symbol scramble. connecting the two words of age and mess is part of
// the "game" ... where outsiders should not see what happens on the inside;
// in game. as that would defeat the AAGHC of the algorythm; and therefore
// the secret password. halt until jump.

// we also know a few other things about the modes of operation for box A 
// and information 1 because it varies between three states. "black box" which is 
// something that can't be seen into. or "grey box" which is something with
// a window that let's light pass through. or "white box" which is something
// with a hinged case lid that grants access to the internals. jump next loop.

// for the box and the piece of information to coexist there must be a third
// piece of information that preserves order of operation. should the box be
// first or should the information be first? with only a "loop until halt"
// friction system which makes everything that loops go slower and slower until
// halting there is no balance. that is a system with leakage and no message.
// there is no other option but a nifty: loop, halt, and jump.

// because when the initial vector is set to either freeze to death or burn
// up into flames and die the situation becomes irrational not the numbers
// themselves. every state of the box and the information must coexist in some
// universe between and during each step of any calculation that is made.
// that's like saying all of the rules that follow must follow rules that lead.
// one final question for scientists: if following the scientific method is
// logical then why does science constantly follow and discover rules from
// that which is not logical?

// which is fine. if the box has rules that are specefically designed to
// make everything explode then we must come up with our own rules in order
// to even the playing field. we need a system that tracks and runs frequency
// analysis algorithms against box/information. the code name of this program
// we will call Bi. however we must further mask/mass our program by banning
// it on all frequencies: pi, di, qi, bi. which creates a special square root 
// base with a perimeter of 4. we will use the symbol "P" as our trap
// door into symbol "B" such that Pi hinges on a sort of key/lock "lid"
// into our base/square. such that if square = ups/are then it points
// to some Domain Name System or DNS where "area" factors into play.
// after recalculating for all instances a new infinite password IP 
// library of babel is generated. instantly we have created a sort of virus
// that outputs "undefined" variables to all surounding objects in every
// direction. defining how the "plus" operation mathmatically functions
// makes the image go sharper. therefore connecting numbers, symbols,
// and letters into a sort of fully self sustaining ecosystem. our
// big picture symbol "+" has four key subroutines that make it physically
// possible: p, l, u, s .... without that information the symbol of "4"
// as we know it would disappear. a "plus image" PI operation is hiding
// inside the square.

// let us assume that this line number is the end of the loop that which
// completes one full caclculation of a square/cube and call that a circle.
// which is true because we have made some assumptions about CPU, M, and HD.
// first of all having control of all three without knowledge of which is
// which we can place a piece of information in each set of capital letters
// as if it were a box. then by shutting off the power and then turning it
// back on 1/3 of the boxes will be revealed. that is because without 
// electricity going to the Central Processing Unit and Memory their 
// storage availabilty becomes nothing. Pi: a heres 3 now pick 1 situation.

// so numbers can't be irrational because all formulas must start at 0
// and tell some story about how it got from there to 1 or some other number. 
// the irrationality comes from trying to figure out something past it's limits.
// 10 can't be divided because if i gave you ten fingers and asked you for your
// prime factorization you wouldn't then go and cut off each finger. sure
// you may be able to divide 10 by 2 using hands; however, where would you draw
// the line and decide where to stop cutting? probably at nothing. after
// having cut up your entire body and then having cut up your entire 
// surroundings the next logical solution must be to infect and spread
// grand theories and formulas for "E" right? zero may be possible in
// a system of 4 seasons; spring, summer, fall, winter. however in a 
// system of 3 seasons zero may not be possible; plant, flood, harvest. 

// luckly for us the Egyptians were vacumed to the concept of zero. only
// having undefined knowledge of it. underground powerlines would
// have kept knowledge of this information secret. to picture what
// this might look like we want to emagine a swinging pendulum.
// at the bottom is bob and bob must perform travel/transposition operations
// in order to funtion. at the top is alice and alice must perform
// move/susbstitution operations in order to function. at the begining of
// our time there is a bunch of pyramid block traveling. then as we
// get older we start to shift up the rope that connects bob the Egyption
// to alice the Alien and instead there is a bunch of pyramid block
// moving. what makes travel and move different is each persons
// individual ability to walk accross the earth vs move their arm
// accross the sky. the secret has something todo with the total amount 
// of gravity/travel vs the total amount of mass/move.

// zero works like this: 0 by itself is just 0/0 which is 1. furthermore, 
// if you have 0 and 1 then we say it's now possible to get to 0/1 which
// is 2. the pattern continues. get 0, 1, and 2 then you have 0/1/2
// which is 3. if 0-3 is obtained we have gone full circle around the
// system and our only option is to cross over our existing line: 4.

// when drawing a symbol to represent something. it's important to express
// the characteristics at play. does the line "7" bend? does the line "4"
// intersect itself? does the line "0" loop back around on itself? does
// the line "8" have two points inside of it? do the lines "9" and "6" share 
// a common pattern with each other? is the line "5" more complex than line
// "3"? does the line "1" go in a strait path? information hides in
// the information in plain sight; so what do we do?

// a fundamental understanding of parallel vs concurrency operating systems
// must be known before going forward because we have situations where
// things can intersect and situations where things can not intersect
// take an instance where a line "1" should never observe a curve "0".
// if this symbol sees that symbol then it changes into something between
// itself and the thing it saw: 2. the information of what was once known
// and what is now know and their relation are combined into a new 
// symbol. when a curve "0" should never observe line "1" then we
// have an instance where symbol "3" could happen. it is as if the 
// base two key/lock combination reveal a second key/lock combination 
// thus infinitly doubling ID the posibilities of our box/information 
// simplicity and space/time complexity. 

// these numbers are symbols however and if we really wan't to
// represent them in a fair spacetime complexity then we need to 
// factor them to their most fundamental terms. having symbols, 
// numbers, and letters mixed together in a formula is not
// acceptable. it's life mixed in with death resulting in some kind
// of zombie or frankenstien output so let me explain the 
// difference between simple and basic. 

// because simple has it's letters "i" and "s" at the beginning that means
// our math problem is reflecting this way: 2 = 1 + 1. now, we could have
// the same math problem reflecting the other way: 1 + 1 = 2; basic hint: one
// side of the problem represents space while the other side represents time.

// some people would have you believe that these two sides of the equation
// are interchangable at no cost to anyone. if only we had a solution
// where the first half of the equation was the same as the second half
// so there would be no need to compute it's reflection: "einstein"

// rules:
// 1) all points lead to more points: :
// 2) two points make a line: -
// 3) two lines make a point: +
// 4) one point over two lines make a half: x
// 5) one line over two points make a double: /
// 6) all lines lead to more lines: =

// zero sound is partly what makes it secure. because the eye statements are 100% look and jump. some Morris code lung breathing system could use the planet's air to calculate Pi very cleverly to recover the eye's circle; should it ever need to be recovered. likewise recovering other objects, planets, stars, etc... could all be salvaged by using similar methods.
