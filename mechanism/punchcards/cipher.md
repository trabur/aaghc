taking 1 char keyboard input at a time it gets ciphered from bottom
to top then back down. the returned random output value shows on
the lightboard. if multiple worker threads are turned on then a string 
up to 6 chars in length (all buttons pressed at once) will be
registered as a single keyboard input.

the mechanism UI itself only shows the center most 45 chars of the
keyboard. these core chars are also known as the kernel. while the
surounding layer the shell or command line interface. 


everything else being user land. 

to setup a computer count the number of cores on the motherboard and
then let that be variable x. for each x let it's number of threads
be variable y then for each y let it's clock speed be variable z.
